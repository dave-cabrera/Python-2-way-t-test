# Python-2-way-t-test

  This procedure will give instructions on how to make a python program that performs two-tailed t tests comparing the means (averages) of two groups 
  when population standard deviations are unknown. The comparison of means t test determines if two groups are significantly different from each other or not. 
  Examples of its use are comparing test grades between two sections of a class, or heights between men and women.

  This process is done by calculating a test statistic and comparing it to a critical value given by the t distribution table. 
  

  The numerator is the mean of the first group minus the mean of the second group, minus 0. The denominator is the standard error, 
  which is the square root of the variance of the first group divided by the sample size of the first group, plus the variance of the second group 
  divided by the sample size of the second group.

  If the test statistic is greater than the critical value, the two groups are significantly different. If the test statistic is less than or equal 
  to the critical value, the two groups similar enough to be considered the same.
